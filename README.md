# Planting Optimisation Tool

A data-driven recommendation system designed to support sustainable reforestation and agroforestry planning in Timor-Leste. The tool identifies the most suitable tree species for a given farm by analysing environmental conditions, species requirements, and geospatial datasets.

This project is developed in collaboration with the xPand Foundation under the Rai Matak Program.

## Purpose

Smallholder farmers in Timor-Leste face low tree-survival rates due to poor environmental matching and limited access to ecological data. The Planting Optimisation Tool addresses this challenge by:

- Analysing farm-level conditions (rainfall, soil pH, elevation, temperature, slope, area);
- Matching farms with optimal, cautionary, and unsuitable tree species;
- Explaining limiting factors that may affect survival;
- Generating simple, accessible reports for field officers and supervisors.

## Core Features

### Species Recommendation
- Suitability scoring based on rainfall, pH, temperature, elevation, soil class, and other variables.  
- Automatic exclusion of species that cannot survive under the farm’s limiting conditions.  
- Identification of key limiting factors for each species.

### Environmental Profiling
- Extraction of environmental variables from geospatial datasets (e.g., rainfall, elevation, soil).  
- Integration with national datasets such as Seeds of Life.  
- Farm-level environmental profiles for decision support.

### Sapling Estimation
- Calculates recommended sapling count based on farm area, terrain, planting profile (e.g. 3m × 3m spacing).

### User-Facing Web Interface
- Input forms for farm conditions.  
- Dashboards showing suitable, cautionary, and excluded species.  
- Visual indicators highlighting limiting environmental factors.  
- PDF report generation with species images and charts.  
- Mobile-friendly layout for field use.
